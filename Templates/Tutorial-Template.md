# Prerequisites
Complete the following tasks prior to [using, launching, adding …] the [feature name]: <li> 

# Dependencies
[Provide dependency information necessary for this tutorial.]

# Remarks
[Provide remarks/considerations necessary for this tutorial.]

# Process (Optional)
[If this tutorial contains more than 3 procedures, add a flow diagram or process statement that puts the procedures and testing into context.]

# Procedure 1
[Identify/Name the procedure to state the purpose of the procedure, such as “Initiate …”, “Setup …t”, “Configure …”, “Launch …”]

[Provide a summary of this procedure. Why is this procedure important.]

## Prerequisites for Procedure 1 [if necessary]
* Inputs (parameter, data type, data format, limits)
* APIs, if necessary

Complete the following steps to achieve [result]: [Each step describes a single action and the result of performing the step.]
1. [Role] [verb] [object]

   **Result:**

   [Example or Sample Code as needed]

2. [Role] [verb] [object]

   **Result:**

   [Example or Sample Code as needed]

   …

## Final Result of Procedure 1:
[Restate the expected result for the procedure]

[Add a transition paragraph between procedures]

# Procedure 2
[Identify/Name the procedure to state the purpose of the procedure, such as “Initiate …”, “Setup …t”, “Configure …”, “Launch …”]

[Provide a summary of this procedure. Why is this procedure important.]

## Prerequisites for Procedure 2 [if necessary]
* Inputs (parameter, data type, data format, limits)
* APIs, if necessary

   …

## Final Result of Procedure 1:
[Restate the expected result for the procedure]


[If there are more procedures, add a transition paragraph between procedures]

[Add a transition paragraph before the testing procedure. Explain its importance and what the test results should demonstrate. Explain any irregular or inconsistent results, what they mean, and how to fix them.]

# Testing Procedure
[include test data and testing procedures within and between sections, as needed. See How To template for delineation, if necessary]

# Sample Code (Optional)

## Introduction

[cut and paste sample code for the entire tutorial]
[add annotations for the code as necessary]

## Code
