# How to Use EOS Documentation Templates

The ENF Developer Relations team (DevRel) developed a set of templates to assist development of documentation for the EOS ecosystem. The templates are written in Markdown (.md) format and provide a structure for your content contribution. Take advantage of these writing tools to assist with your content contribution. These templates are guidelines for various types of content and will help you organize your content with a common look and feel. These templates are not a substitute for content accuracy and completeness.

To submit your documentation to the EOS Network Foundation (ENF), create a fork of the receiving repository and then add work on your own fork. From there, do a PR from your fork to the main branch. DevRel reviews the PR, suggests changes, if any, and after your approval the PR can be merged. Refer to the [Docs Contribution Process](processes/docs-contribution-process.md) for more information.

ENF Templates use MarkDown language.

Text identified within brackets [...] are instructions to you for the type of information to include in the topic.

If a section title contains "(Optional)" and you don’t need to add information for that topic, add the description “N/A”.

When the DevRel team receives your documentation, we will review, edit, and test it before adding it to the DevRel repository. Please make sure to include your email or telegram address so we can reach out to you with any questions.

## Feature Explainer Template
This template is a guideline to use when documenting a feature. It provides information about the feature, how it fits into the big picture of the EOS blockchain as well as any dependencies and constraints. It also provides information on related use cases and expected results, as well as example code.

You can find the [Explainer template](Feature-Explainer-Template.md) in the Templates folder in the DevRel repository.

## Feature Overview Template
This template provides a quick outline of the [feature name]. Links to more detailed information are listed at the bottom of the document.

You can find the [Overview template](Feature-Overview-Template.md) in the Templates folder in the DevRel repository.

## How To Template
This template provides step-by-step instructions to produce a desired result. It provides prerequisite information, when to use it,  as well as expected results. This template also provides an option for example code.

You can find the [How To template](HowTo-template.md) in the Templates folder in the DevRel repository.

## Tutorial Template
This template provides an educational lesson with context. It contains one or more procedures to demonstrate mastery of a concept. A tutorial instructs users how to perform/achieve a particular goal. You need to add test data or tools necessary to complete and test the tutorial. A tutorial should contain 7 or less steps, if possible. If you have more than 7 steps, consider dividing the tutorial into two separate tutorials. Keep the tutorial experience for the user to an hour or less, if possible.

You can find the [Tutorial template](Tutorial-Template.md) in the Templates folder in the DevRel repository.
