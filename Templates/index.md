# How to Use EOS Doc Templates

The EOS Doc Templates are a guide for contributors to submit content to the EOS Documentation Portal. 

The Templates provide the following:

* They provide a structure and guidelines for your content

* They use MarkDown language

* They have instructions for the type of information for your content within brackets [...]

* They contain optional section titles - If a section title contains "(Optional)" and you don’t need to add information for that topic, add the description “N/A”.

Please include your email or telegram address so DevRel can reach out to you with any questions.

## Available Templates

The following templates are available as guidelines to your content:

| Template | Description|
| --- | ---|
|[Overview](../Templates/Feature-Overview-Template.md)| Provides a quick outline of a feature. Links to more detailed information are provided at the bottom of the document.|
|[Explainer](../Templates/Feature-Explainer-Template.md)|Provides a guideline to use when documenting a feature. It provides information about the feature, how it fits into the big picture of the EOS blockchain as well as any dependencies and constraints. It also provides information on related use cases and expected results, as well as example code.|
|[Tutorial](../Templates/Tutorial-Template.md)| Provides an educational lesson with context. It contains one or more procedures to demonstrate mastery of a concept. A tutorial instructs users how to perform/achieve a particular goal. You need to add test data or tools necessary to complete and test the tutorial. A tutorial should contain 7 or less steps, if possible. If you have more than 7 steps, consider dividing the tutorial into two separate tutorials. Keep the tutorial experience for the user to an hour or less, if possible.|     
|[How To](../Templates/How-to-Template.md)| This template provides step-by-step instructions to produce a desired result. It provides prerequisite information, when to use it,  as well as expected results. This template also provides an option for example code.|
