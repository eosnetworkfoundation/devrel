When you create a new DevRel branch, use the following branch naming convention:

`<feature|fix>-devrel#<issue#>`

For example: feature-devrel#52  
             fix-devrel#56  

    Use `feature` if adding new content

    Use `fix` if updating or deleting existing content

    The `issue#` is the issue number listed on the devrel project board (the number on the right, not the left)

        (Use *devrel#N* because we need to know where issue resides)

**Note**: If doing a feature and a fix, split them into 2 PRs
