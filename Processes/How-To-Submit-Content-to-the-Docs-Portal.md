## How To Submit Content to EOS Documentation Portal

Once you have written the content you wish to contribute to the [EOS Documentation Portal](https://docs.eosnetwork.com), you need to submit it for review. 

## Steps to Submit Content

Complete the following steps to submit your content to DevRel:

1. Create a fork of the receiving repository.

2. Add work on your own fork in .md format.

3. Create and submit a PR from your fork to the `main` branch of the target repo.

4. DevRel then reviews the PR, suggests changes, if any.

5. After approval the PR can be merged.
