## How To Approve and Signoff Content before Publication to the EOS Documentation Portal
The content review process ensures the accuracy and the completeness of submitted content. Once content is submitted to the DevRel team, the team refines your content to technical writing best practices and tests your content for any gaps or confusion. After the DevRel team reviews and tests the content, they submit the final documentation to you for your review, approval, and signoff.

Complete the following steps to approve and signoff content before publication:
1. A DevRel team member submits a Pull Request in GitHub of your content (document) and assigns you, the author, as the reviewer
2. The author carefully reviews the content and makes any changes in GitHub
3. When all changes have been incorporated by the DevRel team member and are checked by the author, the author adds an “Approved” comment to the Pull Request 

   The content is now ready to be added to the EOS Documentation portal.
