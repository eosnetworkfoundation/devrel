# Submit Content to the EOS Docs

Follow the steps below to create or update content on the [EOS Docs](https://docs.eosnetwork.com)

## Fork the docs repo

First, head over to the [docs repository](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/docs) and fork the code. 
Once you have it, you'll want to switch to the `staging` branch, and create a new branch off of that.

**If you create a branch off `main` your PR will be behind!**

Create your files in `.md` format following the structure that the rest of the docs hierarchy uses. 


## Once you're ready for review

Create and submit a PR from your fork to the `staging` branch of the `docs` repository.

Our team will then review the PR and possibly suggest changes. 

After approvals from our team, we will merge in your PR and that information will then be available after our next periodic push from staging to production.
