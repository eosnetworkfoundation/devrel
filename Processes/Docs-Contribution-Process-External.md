The templates are written in Markdown (.md) format and provide a structure for your content contribution. Take advantage of these writing tools to assist with your content contribution. These templates are guidelines for various types of content and will help you organize your content with a common look and feel. These templates are not a substitute for content accuracy and completeness.

You can provide content to the DevRel team in various formats.
